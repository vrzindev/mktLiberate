## 📌 Project Description

**mktLiberate** is an automated system designed to **manage and release queues** on **MikroTik** devices. The system was developed to **simplify network management**, allowing users to make **adjustments intuitively** through a **web interface**.

The project consists of a **Python backend** that connects to **MikroTik** devices via **SSH** to execute specific commands, and a **web frontend** that enables users to interact with the system in a **simple and efficient way**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔹 **IP Release**: The system allows the release of **specific IPs** on the network by disabling queues and creating an **address list** with a **defined timeout**.
- 🎨 **Intuitive Web Interface**: A **simple and user-friendly web interface** for entering the **router's IP** and performing the release.
- ⚙️ **Command Automation**: Automatic execution of **MikroTik commands** via **SSH** to **disable queues** and create **address lists**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python**: For backend logic and **SSH** connection to **MikroTik** devices.
- 🔐 **Paramiko**: Python library for **SSH** connections.
- 🎨 **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web interface.
- 🌐 **WSGI**: Interface for serving the web application.
